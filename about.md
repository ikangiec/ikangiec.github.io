### a bit of wickedness...

> I aim for simplicity in many things in my life, yet my system is complicatedly wired. Deep down, I’m more than humble and genuine than you can ever imagine, but I’m very headstrong and I stand in my own way. I trained myself to think/operate more manly. Ahem.. of course I mean, mentally. I’m a doer, a hustler.. and I tend to surprise people out of nowhere. I’m malleable, very... now and forever.

### and... something more serious?

> Uhm… on my second thought, I think I’ll consider adding this part if I get enough requests about it. Meanwhile, you're welcome to check out my other [wordpress site](http://myvoice.kangiechan.com/) for something more personal. You can read that language right? I'm sure you can figure that out.
